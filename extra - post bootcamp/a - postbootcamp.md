## Retrospective / Feedback Session (40m.)


## Portfolio

-->

Some options:

1. Github profile
2. Create a portfolio Website
  - 2.a with Express. Similar setup as we do in module 2, express for the backend + handlebars for the views (probably no need to have a DB)
  - 2.b with React


- Github profile: doesn't take much time + very useful (specially for those who are more a technical profile, a coding person).
- Website portfolio: can also be interesting, specially for those who want to pitch themselves towards more creative roles


- 2.b: Personally, I don't see much value in using React (it is great for web apps and interactivity but a portfolio doesn't need much of that). Also, it can make deployment more difficult.

- In short, I would go for a nice Github profile (definitely) and/or a website with express.

- In your Github profile you can "pin" the projects we build during the bootcamp

- If you create your own website, you can create your own design OR use pre-made HTML templates (can save you hours and get you a very clean ux for a little price, just google "html portfolio templates")


- Examples of good Github profiles:
  - https://github.com/Jennie-QIAN
  - https://github.com/t4ms
  - https://github.com/daina-slezaite

- Example of a horrible Github profile:
  - https://github.com/luisjunco

## Continue Learning

  - Continue Learning --> KEEP CODING

  - Example - post-bootcamp github activity:
    ![](../media/images/post-bootcamp-github-activity.png)


  - How: 
      - improve project 3 (add new functionality, improve ux etc)
      - create a portfolio website
      - new project (js + new things) +++
      - katas (js) +
      - javascript30: https://javascript30.com/
      - TypeScript course: https://rootlearn.notion.site/TypeScript-course-details-96b1df73b90c44f99c61a0a49ab9ecd9


  - Technologies and things to learn (pick one or two at a time):
    - further practice in JavaScript +++
      - Get better at problem solving (codewars)
    - further practice in React ++
      - e.g. custom hooks, Tanstack Query...
      <!-- @todo: create repo/gist with some info/videos -->
    - TypeScript +++
    - Next.js +++
    - AI Engineering (eg. integrating with an LLM)
    - SQL Databases (e.g. PostgreSQL)
    - TDD / Testing
    - Docker
    - Tailwind

    - React Query
      - Why: 11m video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxkbf5QMA2g
      - Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrliU0e09io


  - Interesting options:
    - build something
    - collaborate with other students
    - follow tutorials & online courses (e.g. Udemy or LinkedIn courses)
    - pair with a mentor (networking, linkedin, ex-ironhacker)
    - join some hackathons

  - Feeling overwhelmed / "I don't know where to start" 
    - APPLY AGILE
    - KEEP DOING LITTLE BY LITTLE
      - things take longer than we expect
      - you will never have something perfect
      - you will never be prepared enough
      - there will always be things I don't know
    - Consistency vs. motivation:

    - "SMART" goals (https://tools.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCTC-Infographic-SMART-Goals-Explained-1200x628-1.jpg)
    - Extra advice on SMART goals:
      - Track (keep track of your progress)
      - Review goals often
      - Be kind with you


- Emotions & Mental health (40m.)


- Finally, remember: YOU CAN MAKE IT.
