# Post-bootcamp suggested planning


## w1: holidays

## w2: 100% focus on job search

## from w3: 50/50


Example:

- morning: job search (cv, linkedin, send apps, follow up)
  - Goal: send 2 job applications/day

- afternoon: code
  - Goals:
    - Mon-Thu: 3h on project work
    - Fri: solve 2x katas

Note: 
- this is just an example
- in case you're in part-time, adapt to your own schedule.
