Issue: stackblitz not working (e.g. not printing anything on the console)

Possible Reasons:
- Page translators seem to be an issue in some cases (e.g. when google chrome is automatically translating the site to another language)
- Extensions (e.g. add blockers and similar)


Things to try:
- Try in incognito
- Try on a different browser
- Disable translations from Google Chrome
- Disable extensions
