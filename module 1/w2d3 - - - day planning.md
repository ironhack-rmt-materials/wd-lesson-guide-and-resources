  - Array methods (e.g. map, filter): https://i.redd.it/t2f5w9bms1271.jpg

- See Project 1 examples (in case we haven't done it yet)

- DOM manipulation: methods & properties [1.5h]

- DOM manipulation: create DOM node [0.5h]

- DOM manipulation: events [1.5h]

- (skip) DOM manipulation: inputs

<!-- @LT:

<!-- 

@todo:
- record a video with an explanation to the code (ie. students can read first the code and then watch the video)
- it would also be good to improve instructions
