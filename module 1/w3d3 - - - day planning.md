- 10am (or once you finish that kata), follow this video to learn how to deploy project 1:

- Once you finish deployment, submit your project URLs in the students portal.
  - DEADLINE to submit project urls: today 13:00h.

- Note: 
  - It's completely normal that the game is not finished yet.
  - Once you finish deployment, submit the urls and then keep working on the game as usual (every time you push new changes, they will be reflected on github pages).
  - Games must be ready end of Thursday (Friday 9am).

- 12:00: standups
