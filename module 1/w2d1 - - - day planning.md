## Day Planning

Planning:

- introduce callback & anonymous functions (do example with forEach) [30min.]
  - Practice forEach (arr of strings + array of objects): https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-me2yip?file=index.js
  - Time: 10min.
  - Solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-byttax?file=index.js

- OOP: intro + oop with plain objects [30min.]
- OOP: ES6 Classes + Exercise I [1.5h]
- OOP: OOP Bakery exercise [30min.]
- OOP: OOP principles [1h]
  - OOP principles
  - inheritance
  - super

- Show "project 1" examples:
  - see: `project 1 examples.md`
  - they can start thinking what they want to build



## Active Learning

- (individual) LAB | JS Expense Tracker  [1.5h]
- (in pairs) Mini Project - JavaScript Quiz  [2.5h]
  - Note: follow the instructions in the unit "Project Brief: JavaScript Quiz"
  <!-- @LT: the project brief includes much more detailed instructions than the units for each specific day -->
- (self-guided) AI as an assisted debugging tool
- (individual) LAB | AI Detective, Fix the Mystery Code [0.5h]

- (bonus) LAB | JavaScript Vikings
- (bonus) JS | Special keyword - this

Also, can already do OOP assessment (DL will be w3d1).

<!-- Note: mini-project research includes reading the unit "JS | Special keyword - this" -->

<!-- 
@todo mini-project: 
- instructions for mini-project are duplicated between project brief & day tasks.
- also, in day 1, instructions say that all team members should clone, but we still haven't seen how to split tasks (so it's better to just do pair programming)
-->
