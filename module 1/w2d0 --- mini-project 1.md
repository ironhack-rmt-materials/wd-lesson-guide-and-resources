# Mini-Project 1


What:
- JavaScript Quiz (JavaScript, OOP, and DOM)

Demo:
- https://luisjunco.github.io/javascript-quiz-project/


Groups:
- Work in groups of 2
- (depending on cohort size, some groups of 3 may be needed)


How:
- Pair programming
- IMPORTANT: tell students to follow pair programming (work together on the same tasks). We still haven't seen how to integrate code changes.
- NOTE: instructions at the moment say that both team members would clone. No need to do that.
