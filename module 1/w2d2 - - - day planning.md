 IMPORTANT: Contents heavy + LAB really demanding = focus on fundamentals.


## Day Planning

 
 Planning:
  - LAB Q&A (short) [20m.]
  - Refresh [30m.]
    - OOP (classes, methods etc)
    - Introduce: pattern with an array of instances of a class + how to iterate through that array.
    - example 1: https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-gg34n7cp?file=index.js
    - example 2 (same, but now we keep the list of shops in the class Company): https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-95nmb3bx?file=index.js
    <!-- @LT: in mini-project d3, they'll need to work with an array of instances + iterate through it -->
  - JS functions [1.5h]
  - Arrays: map, reduce, filter [2h] -- `focus!!`
  - Arrays: sort and reverse -- self guided



## Active Learning

<!-- afternoon: show some project examples -->

- (individual) LAB | JS Presidents [1.5h]
- (in pairs) Mini Project - JavaScript Quiz - Day 2 [2.5h]
- (bonus) LAB | Greatest movies of all time
