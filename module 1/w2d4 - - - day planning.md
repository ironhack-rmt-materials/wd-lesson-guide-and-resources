<!-- @todo:
- create a quiz to start the day, with some tricky questions.
- for that quiz, can use the result of mini-project js-quiz
- explain that today we'll learn why those are the answers
-->


## Planning

- LAB / mini-project Q&A [20m.]

- (skip) Recap from yesterday

- Recap with the most important concepts we've seen so far... (encouragement):
  <!-- @LT: no technical concepts, goal here is to encourage students to keep learning -->
  - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-0GMbPHLcF-uXCMaKwkWF65ZUgI-fTjpBJ9SfZd1eVY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Small exercise: ask everyone to open one of the labs we did 1 week ago.


- Variable scope, hoisting and shadowing [1h]
- Value vs. Reference and Mutable Data Types [1.5h]
- Async and Callbacks [1h]

- extra: intro concepts that we'll use tomorrow [30m]
  - a) position (relative vs. absolute)
  - b) units (px vs. vw)
  - c) detect keyboard events
  - Initial code: https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-mxnyde?file=index.html
    <!-- @LT: remember to fork -->
