Notes:
- in current version of the prework (jun2022)


Before git topics:
- how to open a terminal in VS Code
- common operations in the cli
  - see where I am: `pwd`
  - list files and directories: `ls` or `ls -al`
  - move to child directory: `cd nameOfDirectory`
  - move to parent directory: `cd ..`
  - autocomplete name of a directory: "tab" key
  - create a directory: `mkdir`



Topics:
- what is git & why it is useful.
  - keep track of changes
  - share code with other developers & integrate changes
- create a directory & go inside it: `mkdir git-demo` + `cd git-demo`
- initialize a repo: `git init`
- create a file: `touch index.html`
- create a file: `touch about.html`
- check current status: `git status`
- add to staging area: `git add index.html`
- check status again: `git status` (now file is added to staging area)
- (optional) un-stage: `git rm --cached <file-name-1>`
- make a commit: `git commit -m "msg"`
- see history: `git log`
- Git vs. Github
- Github: upload an existing repository
  - create a repo on github
  - push the repo we've created
- Github: fork & clone
