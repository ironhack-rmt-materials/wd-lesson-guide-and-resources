## Day Planning


Morning:
- Q&A [20m.]
- Warmup [20m.]
  - Solve: get maximum value in an array of numbers
    - pattern: 
      - declare a variable with max = 0
      - iterate through the array and update that variable (forEach).
    - edge-case: what happens if all numbers are negative ?
    - explain: `max = amounts[0]` and `max = -Infinity`
  - Refresh:
    - arrays (declare, access by position, push)
    - forEach()
    - functions (declare, invoke, function arguments, return)
- Slides: Bootcamp Intro V [5min.]
- Data Types - Objects [1.5h]
- Arrays & Objects (nested data structures) [1h]
- Test Driven Development (TDD) [20m.]
- Unit Testing with Jasmine [40m.]

Afternoon:
- Quick retro [30m.]
- Survey [5min.]

<!-- 

@consider:
- suggestion from David Henriques: standups in week 1 / summary with the process of each one.
- before the retro, consider adding a standup or temperature check.
- eg. everyone can add an emoji/stamp reflecting where they feel they are.
- eg.
  - I feel (overwhelmed, happy, proud...)
  - I feel (i'm behind, i'm ok, i'm doing great...)
  - ...
