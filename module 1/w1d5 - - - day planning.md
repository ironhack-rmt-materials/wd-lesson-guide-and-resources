## Day Planning


Morning:
- Q&A [20m.]
- Warmup [20m.]
  - Solve: get maximum value in an array of numbers
    - `const numbers = [2, 6, 10, 7, 4, 1, 9];`
    - pattern: 
      - declare a variable with max = 0
      - iterate through the array and update that variable (forEach).
    - edge-case: what happens if all numbers are negative ?
    - explain: `max = amounts[0]` and `max = -Infinity`
  - Refresh:
    - arrays (declare, access by position, push)
    - forEach()
    - functions (declare, invoke, function arguments, return)
- Slides: Bootcamp Intro V [5min.]
- Data Types - Objects [1.5h]
- Arrays & Objects (nested data structures) [1h]
- Test Driven Development (TDD) [20m.]
- Unit Testing with Jasmine [40m.]

Afternoon:
- Quick retro [30m.]
- Survey [5min.]

<!-- 

@consider:
- suggestion from David Henriques: standups in week 1 / summary with the process of each one.
- before the retro, consider adding a standup or temperature check.
- e.g. everyone can add an emoji/stamp reflecting where they feel they are.
- e.g.
  - I feel (overwhelmed, happy, proud...)
  - I feel (i'm behind, i'm ok, i'm doing great...)
  - ...

    - "We actually still interview people without allowing them to use AI, other than autocomplete, for first technical screens,"
    - "We've hired lots of people who are fantastic programmers who actually have no experience with AI tools," Truell said. "We would much rather hire those people and then teach them on the job."
