<!-- Status: ready -->



<!-- 

@LT: 
- today's lab includes a lot of problem solving
- solve together at least 1 or 2 iterations from the lab

-->




## Refresh: JS Intro & Data Types

<!-- typeof, data types, first-class functions... -->

- Instructions: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ih-w1d2-refresh-zzgfcl?file=index.js

- How: 
  - in pairs (20min)
  - together, in the main room (10min.)

- Solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ih-w1d2-refresh-chkkkv?file=index.js





## DAY PLANNING:

- Q&A [20m]
- (skip) Refresh
  - Scope
  - Numbers: int, decimal, NaN, modulo operator, Math.random()
  - Strings: how to create strings, concatenate, length, charAt, indexOf, slice()
  - Booleans, AND, OR, Truthy & falsy values
  - typeof
- Slides: Bootcamp Intro IV [10m]
- Conditionals and Loops [30m/1h]
- Functions Intro [1h]
- Data Types - Arrays [1.5h]
- Problem-solving: Solve together 1 iteration from LAB [30m]
  - "LAB | JS Challenges I (Arrays & Functions)" - Iteration 1 | Count Repetition
  - Possible solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-gan8bw?file=index.js
  - Explain (how to work with Jasmine / automated testing): 
    - Open SpecRunner.html with Live Server
    - You don't need to invoke your functions (the tests will invoke them)
    - How to debug (can open the console in the browser)
    - How to see the tests



## Active Learning

- (individual) LAB | JS Functions & Arrays
- (in pairs) LAB | JS Challenges I (Arrays & Functions)
- (bonus - self-guided) JS | Debugging and Error Handling


<!-- 

@LT: these are the first labs with Jasmine. 

Explain (ideally, do a quick DEMO):
- how they can run the tests 
  - open SpecRunner.html with "Live Server"
- how they can debug / console.log 
- where they can see the file with the tests
