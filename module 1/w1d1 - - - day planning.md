<!-- 


@LT:

IMPORTANT:
- Go very fast through basic concepts
- Give plenty of time for Git concepts +++
- Give plenty of time for LAB


@todo:
- create guided "Lab Zero" (how to work with git & labs) +++
  - fork, clone, commits, submit PR, etc)
  - this lab can then serve as a guide/cheatsheet for the first days.
  - include cheatsheet (at the end)
  - include Q&A. Common errors: 
    - cloned the original repo
    - terminal not in the correct directory

@todo:
- update gist with guidelines to submit labs (fork, clone, PR, etc)
- improve demo/codealong (make it more interesting)
- improve CSS
  - color palette
  - fonts +++

@consider: "Mini-Project: Static Site"
- w1d1 + w1d2: instead of labs, work on a mini-project (HTML+CSS static site).
- individual / in pairs ?
- This can give much more room for students with prev. experience in HTML and CSS to experiment and go the extra mile.
- w1d3: choose a couple of projects to present + the rest will share their links. Or split in rooms, so that all of them present.
- Notes: 
  - the first steps will need to be very simple/guided, for those without previous experience.
  - the project will include very specific instructions for a very basic MVP + encourage students to go further and implement additional things as they wish
  - students can create a repo from scratch (instead of forking). We can introduce labs on w1d3.
  - d1 can start mobile-first (e.g. homepage + menu).
  - d2 can add a second page + apply responsive + flexbox. 
  - one little disadvantage is that it may take us a few more days to detect students struggling (esp. if it's in pairs).

  Consider: 
  - simplify this (some students may find this overwhelming, especially the network panel)
  - alternative: show the dev tools while we do a codealong (code much more simple)

## Intro Students Portal

    Notes: 
    - We will use it as a guideline 
    - You can find there interesting contents
    - A lot of "Extra labs" and activities

Notes:
- Students know all the theory 
- Instead, build something together
- Opportunity to speak about good practices & common mistakes


## Pair programming [10m]
