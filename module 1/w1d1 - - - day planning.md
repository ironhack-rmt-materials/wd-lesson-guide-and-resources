<!-- 


@LT:

IMPORTANT:
- Go very fast through basic concepts
- Give plenty of time for Git concepts +++
- Give plenty of time for LAB


@todo:
- create guided "Lab Zero" (how to work with git & labs) +++
  - fork, clone, commits, submit PR, etc)
  - this lab can then serve as a guide/cheatsheet for the first days.
  - include cheatsheet (at the end)
  - include Q&A. Common errors: 
    - cloned the original repo
    - terminal not in the correct directory

@todo:
- update gist with guidelines to submit labs (fork, clone, PR, etc)
- improve demo/codealong (make it more interesting)
- improve CSS
  - color palette
  - fonts +++

@consider: "Mini-Project: Static Site"
- w1d1 + w1d2: instead of labs, work on a mini-project (HTML+CSS static site).
- individual / in pairs ?
- This can give much more room for students with prev. experience in HTML and CSS to experiment and go the extra mile.
- w1d3: choose a couple of projects to present + the rest will share their links. Or split in rooms, so that all of them present.
- Notes: 
  - the first steps will need to be very simple/guided, for those without previous experience.
  - the project will include very specific instructions for a very basic MVP + encourage students to go further and implement additional things as they wish
  - students can create a repo from scratch (instead of forking). We can introduce labs on w1d3.
  - d1 can start mobile-first (e.g. homepage + menu).
  - d2 can add a second page + apply responsive + flexbox. 
  - one little disadvantage is that it may take us a few more days to detect students struggling (esp. if it's in pairs).

## Intro from PMs [30m]


## (skip) Icebreaker activity
  - option 1: introduce yourself
    - tell us about you
    - where you're from, background...

<!-- Note: this is also in the slides "Bootcamp Intro", on Day 1 -->

> A web browser is a program that allows people to access and view websites on the internet. When you type a website address, the browser sends a request to the server where the site is stored and then shows the page on your screen. It also lets users interact with links, forms, and buttons on websites. Browsers are essential tools for exploring and using the internet every day.

  Consider: 
  - simplify this (some students may find this overwhelming, especially the network panel)
  - alternative: show the dev tools while we do a codealong (code much more simple)

## Intro Students Portal

    Notes: 
    - We will use it as a guideline 
    - You can find there interesting contents
    - A lot of "Extra labs" and activities

- CSS [1.5h]


Notes:
- Students know all the theory 
- Instead, build something together
- Opportunity to speak about good practices & common mistakes


## Pair programming [10m]
