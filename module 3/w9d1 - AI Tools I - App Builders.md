# AI Tools I - App Builders



## Intro

- What we'll see in this session
    - AI App Builders (aka AI coding agents / AI prototyping tools)

- "Vibe Coding"



## AI App Builders

Some popular AI-powered app builders / AI prototyping tools:
- bolt.new
- lovable.dev
- Replit Agent
- ...

Other related tools:
- UI generators: v0.dev (react, tailwind)

Examples:
- create an Instant Resume Analyzer

- For an app that will allow users to practice their language skills by having a realtime voice conversations with an AI, create the private area for logged in users (users need to be able to start a new conversation, see how many minutes they have remaining, see some stats, logout, etc).

- create the homepage for a furniture company that offers beautiful pieces of furniture and shipping everywhere in Germany

- create a REST API with Express and PostgreSQL. API should implement auth functionality with jwt, CRUD on projects and CR on tasks.

- Create a react app to generate random pairs with students. The app will let you create a cohort & add a list of students for that cohort (by entering all the names in comma separated format). Once you have created a cohort, you can generate random pairs (if there's an odd number of students, it will generate a group of 3). If you like the pairs generated, you can click a button to confirm. One you confirm, those pairs will be added to a "pairs history". The user can visit the pairs history to see a table with all the students that have already been matched together. Also, when you create new random pairs, the app will avoid pairing students that have already worked together.



## Use cases

- MVP Development
    - Building a functional "Minimum Viable Product"
    - Especially for relatively simple apps / internal tools

- Prototyping 
    - Instead of showing investors static Figma slides, founders create live, clickable apps with real data to demonstrate their vision.

- Brainstorming (if you don't have clear specs, it may be great to give you some interesting ideas)



## Warnings and limitations ⚠️

- Requires some basic knowledge
    - You don't need to code, but you do need to understand concepts like "database tables," "API keys," and "deployment" to get past the 80% mark.

- Complex apps
    - With current state-of-the-art tooling, AI app builders work well for MVPs and simple products, but often struggle with complex applications (e.g. apps that require deep domain logic, long-term maintainability, or nuanced architectural decisions).

- The "Vibe Coding" Ceiling
    - There is a limit to what "just talking" can achieve.
    - If your app requires highly specific business rules, the AI may start "hallucinating" solutions that look correct but fail in edge cases.

- Performance, Security & Compliance Gaps
    - Not for "Big Tech" scale: Great for thousands of users; risky for millions without a human dev team.

- Using AI to find quick solutions vs. learning
    - This tools may be great to find a quick solution but, if your goal is to learn the fundamentals, they may actually work against you by obscuring core concepts.
