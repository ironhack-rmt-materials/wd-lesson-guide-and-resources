## Environment variables


Backend / Express:

  1. How to add environment variables in the Backend / Express:
    - For development, we use a `.env` file
    - For production, we will add them on Render.com

  2. How to use them in the code (in express): `process.env.XXXX` (e.g. "process.env.ORIGIN")



Frontend / Vite:

  1. How to add environment variables in the Frontend / Vite:
    - For development, we use a `.env` file (important: make sure variables start with `VITE_` for example, "VITE_API_URL")
    - For production, we will add them on Netlify.

  2. How to use them in the code (in Vite): `import.meta.env.xxx` (e.g. "import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL")

  Note: `.env` is not in .gitignore
  (but `*.local` will be ignored; for example: ".env.local")
