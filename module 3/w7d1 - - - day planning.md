## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

Give feedback to students (e.g. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

-->





## Planning

- Intro to module 3 [30min]
  - see `Intro to  module 3.md`

- (skip) Node | Introduction [30min]
  <!-- @LT: just mention a few ideas -->

- ES6 modules vs. Common JS [30min]

- (skip) Node | The Internet & HTTP Server

- Express | Introduction [2h]

<!-- 
(optional) mini-project-3:
- do a quick demo on how to run both the client and server
- (can follow the instructions given in the students portal, important thing is that students get familiar with running 2 apps at the same time)
-->


## Active Learning

- (individual) LAB | Express Basic Server

- (in groups, 3:30pm) Mini Project
  - Read project brief + work on tasks for day 1.

- Bonus: 
  - Codewars Katas
  - JavaScript Event Loop Visualized (ColorCode, 30min.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkHnAo8GmE
  - Learn Express Middleware (Web Dev Simplified, 15min.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY6icfhap2o
    - Includes quite a few topics about express & middleware (also some topics like "req.query" that we'll see in the following days)

<!--
@todo:
- branches: include some self-guided resources or create a video (instructions for mini-project suggest to work on "develop")
-->

<!-- workload is relatively light (most students finished mini-project early) -->
