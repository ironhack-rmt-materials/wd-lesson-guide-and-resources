  - tomorrow: will be demanding (auth)


- (skip) Ironlauncher
  <!-- @LT: do this w8d2 instead -->


- Intro to "Express | REST API" [1h]
  - see list of topics to cover below


- (Self-guided) Express | REST API
  - see notes below.

  

## Intro to "Express | REST API"

Explain: why is important to do it self-guided (since we're approaching the end of the bootcamp).

Refresh REST [10min.]
- slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/194i1dCV2vpqTN5T3yC5lysvfS-_fnEkok97QpaOtb3w/edit?usp=sharing
<!-- note: can also this part (the unit in the students portal includes guidelines for REST) -->


Explain: how to extract routes to specific files
- Explain on the app from yesterday.
- example: https://github.com/ironhack-sept2024-devstructors/express-iron-restaurant/commit/cd281f2d8ec21541734e2914378f60f6ca30f6ee


Explain: some other topics that they'll find in "Express | REST API"
- push: `Project.findByIdAndUpdate(projectId, { $push: { tasks: newTask._id } }`
- Validation: `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(projectId)` (check if format is valid, even if it doesn't exist in the db)


Quick intro to "IronLauncher"
- In the unit "Express | REST API", the initial code is created with ironlauncher
- When you generate the app, you will be asked if you want to have auth. Choose `No, thank you ðŸš€`
- ![ironlauncher auth](../media/images/ironlauncher-auth.jpg)





## Active Learning / Afternoon

<!-- @LT: workload to do this 3 things (self-guided + mini-project + recording) is very reasonable, specially if we finish lectures by 1pm -->

1. Submit project preferences
  - Deadline: tomorrow 10am.

2. "Express | REST API"
    <!-- Follow the steps in this unit, starting from the section "Project Management API" -->
    - How: individual or in pairs (same groups that we use for mini-project)

3. Mini Project - REST API - Day 4


4. Watch Recording "Auth: intro and hash algorithms" (1h): https://www.loom.com/share/99e0abae2c9346a3ba84d1e178c06b48?sid=e471b840-b8a6-44a1-9070-4f5a5f662518


Bonus: 
- Implement your routes with `async/await` instead of `.then().catch()`


<!-- 
Extra bonus:
1. Research about the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller)
2. Follow this video and apply the concept to your Express app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOLgvMxSpgA
