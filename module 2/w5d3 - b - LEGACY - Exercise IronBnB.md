## Exercise IronBnB

Instructions: https://github.com/luisjunco/exercise-react-ironbnb-client-vite

How:
- individual

Time:
- Some students get all the functionality in about 2h (even with bonus things in 2-4h).
- Some students need a lot of help (e.g. 2-3h to get routing + display the list of apartments or start the functionality to create)




Notes:
- the api doesn't support PUT and DELETE (tested on Postman)
