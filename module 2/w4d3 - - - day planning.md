<!-- 


@todo:
- improve planning + improve steps in demo (e.g. create .md with steps to follow)
- create slides or cheatsheet for state ?

-->






## Day Planning
 
- LAB Q&A [20m]

- Refresh:
  - Props: create a component `<Banner />` + pass "message" as props
  - Lists and `.map()`
  - Conditional rendering


- [LESSON] React | State hook and events [1.5h]

- [LESSON] Codealong "popcorn-time I" [2h]

<!-- 

Note:
- consider introducing React callbacks today
- Example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-ncjzuqyx?file=components%2FParent.jsx
- Note: this can also be done as a self-guided activity (or research)
-->

- (optional) End-of-day summary [10m]
