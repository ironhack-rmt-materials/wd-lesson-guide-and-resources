## Git 

During this week, explain:

- VS Code Source Control
  - see files changed + compare changes
  - add to staging area
  - make a commit
  - other operations:
    - stage / un-stage / revert
    - stage only some parts of a file

- see history of commits

- Branches (see `extra - git branches.md`)
