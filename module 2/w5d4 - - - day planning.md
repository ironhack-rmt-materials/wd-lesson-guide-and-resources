<!--

Notes after m2-m3 swap:
- Creating a Backend API: do in class (instead of self-guided)
- env variables: skip for now (explain in m3 or if they need for their project)
- Projects: connect directly to the rest api in production (skip having it running in localhost)

- This endpoint returns a 404, but the tests will still pass (the unit tests mock the http request)
- UPDATE (may 25): 
  - assessment will be fixed to use the new api url
