## Topics


- HTTP (refresh)


- (skip) HTTP headers
  > HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.

  - See MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

  - Examples:
    - Set-Cookie
    - User-Agent (Identify the user agent / browser)
    - Content-Type (Indicates the media type of the resource.)


- (skip) Content Types

  > "What if we wanted to request some data from a website across the internet and then do something programmatic with that data?"


- JSON

  <!-- @LT: 
  - can show movies.json from previous codealong
  - alternative: ask chatgpt to generate json with a list of recipes
  -->

  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) 
  - Format to transfer/exchange data (also used to store)
  - Very common (even in systems that don't use JavaScript)

  - Main differences between JSON and JS objects:
    - JSON: property names must be in quotes
    - JSON: double quotes (js objects can use single quotes)
    - JSON: cannot store the following data types: functions, date, undefined


  - JSON vs. JavaScript objects:
