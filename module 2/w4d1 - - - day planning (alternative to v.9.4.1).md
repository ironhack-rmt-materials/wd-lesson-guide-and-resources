<!-- 
@todo: 
- add solutions
- improve iterations (e.g. add bonus with some css)
- bonus: research props
-->

- (individual) LAB | Intro Node

- (self-guided) "Continue watching React Tutorial"


Bonus:
- HOF exercises and/or Katas
- LAB | React Props Training



<!-- 

Review planning w4d1.
Consider:
- intro to props (e.g. a self-guided video)
- "LAB React Props Training" as mandatory w4d1 ?

-->


<!-- 
@LT: make pairs for mini-project-2
-->
