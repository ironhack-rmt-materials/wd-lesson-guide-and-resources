## Active Learning

<!-- @LT: tell students they may want to ask someone if they want to partner for project 2 -->


- (individual) LAB React Exponents Counter

- (individual) LAB React Forms
  - note: for the bonus iterations, before you start a refactor, it's always a good idea to make a commit (that way, if you need to roll back, you can just discard the changes with "git restore")

- (in pairs) Mini Project | React App (Day 4)

  <!--
  LT: 
  - discuss, functionality to edit ("Create a form component that allows the user to update an existing item from the items list)

  Note:
  - We will have some time for pending tasks on the mini-project next week (w5d1, w5d2, w5d3)
  -->


Bonus:
- Implement search filter (web dev simplified, 14min.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1cklb4aeXA&t=335s
- In the students portal, you'll find quite a few extra labs
