### Guidelines for LAB

@TA:

- `npm init -y`

- `npm install express`

- `npm i --save-dev nodemon`
  (if you have installed globally you can also skip that step)

- `run nodemon app.js`
  (you need to be inside the folder that contains app.js file)
  that way you you can see the updates live when your writing in app.js

- dirname takes 2 underscores _ _ => `__dirname`

- remember to have `"/views/<name of you file here>"`

- the images and css can use:
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/<name of you file here>" />`
  - `<img src ='/images/<name of you file here>' />`
  - `background-image: url('/images/<name of you file here>');`

- CSS changes can may need to refresh the page to be applied
